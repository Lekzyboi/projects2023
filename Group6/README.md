# Summary Description of the Project

Breast cancer is a significant health issue affecting millions of women worldwide, and early detection is critical for improved patient outcomes. Histopathology analysis is a fundamental tool used to identify cancerous tissue, and it is a manual task performed by trained histopathologists. Based on that, in this project we aim to explore the use of supervised learning techniques to classify breast cancer histopathology images. Specifically, we will investigate whether a machine learning technique can be able to identify specific features or patterns in histopathology images that are indicative of breast cancer.
The importance of this project lies in the critical role of histopathology analysis in cancer detection. The current manual process is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and there is a significant potential for human error. We believe that by developing a classification model that accurately reproduces the manual task of histopathology analysis, we are making a meaningful contribution to the fight against breast cancer. 
Also, the results of the model classification of the histopathology images will be analyzed by a biomedical scientist with experience in histology. This analysis will validate the model’s performance and identify any areas for improvement. Therefore, by combining the expertise of the biomedical scientist with the power of a supervised learning technique, we aim to develop an accurate and reliable breast cancer diagnosis tool.

# Research Questions
* Research question: Can supervised learning be used to identify specific features or patterns in histopathology images that are indicative of breast cancer? 


# Database
* ### Breast Histopathology Images Dataset [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images)


# Methodology


We are going to explore machine learning techniques, especially a supervised learning technique to classify breast cancer histopathology images. We aim to explore the results of the classification considering multiple metrics, such as: precision, recall, accuracy, false positive rate, false negative rate, and so on. Also, the metrics results and the mistakes made by the model are going to be evaluated by a biomedical scientist with experience in histology, so we can understand and adjust the hyperparameters of the model accordingly to produce a reliable and accurate model.


# Tools

Python, Google Collab, Deep Learning Libraries ( Scikit-learn, Tensorflow) , Data visualization libraries ( Matplotlib, seaborn, plotly ) and whatever tools needed to complete the project.
